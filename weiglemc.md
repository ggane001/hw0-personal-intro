**Name:** Dr. Michele Weigle (pronounced "WHY-gull")

**CS or other major:** CS. I earned my PhD from [UNC in Computer Science](http://www.cs.unc.edu/) in 2003, studying computer networking and TCP congestion control. 

**Hometown:** I’m from [St. Francisville, Louisiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Francisville,_Louisiana) and have lived in the South all of my life (except for two summers in Boston and San Francisco).

**In-class/Online:** I'm teaching this class in-class and online.  =)

**Why CS 625?** I joined ODU in 2006 and started out researching vehicular networking and teaching networking courses.  Since 2011, I have been working with the [WS-DL research group](http://ws-dl.cs.odu.edu/) and teaching [CS 725/825 Information Visualization](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~mweigle/CS725-S19/Home). I was asked to develop [CS 625 Data Visualization](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~mweigle/CS625-F19/Home) for the upcoming Data Science MS degree.

**Research/Tech interests:** My research interests are in web archiving, web science, and information visualization. One of my research goals is to apply visualization techniques to interfaces to help general users and humanities scholars access and work with web archives more efficiently.

**Interesting things:**

  1. I’m a big college football and basketball fan, and my favorite teams are the [LSU Tigers](http://www.lsusports.net), [UNC Tar Heels](http://www.goheels.com), and of course, our ODU Monarchs.  
  1. I’m married, and my husband also has a PhD in Computer Science (scientific visualization). We have two sons (ages 7 and 10) and a dog (a 15 year-old border collie/english setter mix named Freckles).
  1. Before I joined ODU, I was faculty in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.clemson.edu) at [Clemson University](http://www.clemson.edu).
